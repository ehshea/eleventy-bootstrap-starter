# Documentation

## Site Variables

- Custom site variables are located in `_data/site.json`. These are used in the templates, such as `_includes/shared/header.njk`.
- Specifically, these are used to dynamically generate page titles and meta descriptions.

## Templates

- Custom templates are located in `_includes/layouts`.
- In order to use `layout: default` instead of `layouts/default.njk`, an alias was added to `.eleventy.js`.

## Local Development

- `npm run start`
    - This runs `eleventy --serve` and `parcel watch ./_assets/js/main.js --out-dir ./_site/assets`.
    - `--out-dir` ensures the assets generated by `parcel` are loaded in the `_site` directory generated by `eleventy`.

## Production Build

- `npm run build`
    - This runs `eleventy` and `parcel build ./_assets/js/main.js --out-dir ./_site/assets`.
    - `parcel build` minifies everything.
    - `--out-dir` ensures the assets generated by `parcel` are loaded in the `_site` directory generated by `eleventy`.

## Styles

- Bootstrap is loaded via npm, and then imported in at `_assets/css/vendor/_bootstrap.scss`
- [Bootstap overrides](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/#importing) are located at `_assets/css/base/_bootstrap-overrides.scss`.
- All `.scss` files are imported into `_assets/css/main.scss`.
- `_assets/css/main.scss` is then imported into `_assets/js/main.js`.
- `_assets/js/main.js` is then bundled via [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/recipes.html#customizing-bootstrap-styles). Parcel magically creates a `_site/assets/main.css` and `_site/assets/main.js` from this file.

## Javascript

- All javascript is imported into `_assets/js/main.js` and then compiled into `_site/assets/main.js` via Parcel
- In order to use [Popovers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/popovers/) and [Tooltips](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/tooltips/), I created `_assets/js/vendor/popover.js` and `_assets/js/vendor/tooltip.js` respectively. These are then imported into `_assets/js/main.js`.
